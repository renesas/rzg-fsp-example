1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates the typical use of the INTC IRQ module APIs.
    The project initializes the IRQ interrupt in Interrupt Controller 
    User is requested to press the push button to trigger the external irq and this then will start toggling of user LED.

2. Hardware and Software Requirement:
    External Hardware : Pmod LED
                      : Pmod BUTTON
    Software          : JLink RTT Viewer v7.96j

3. Hardware settings:
    Boot Mode:
    Boot mode 3 (1.8-V Single, Quad, or Octal serial flash memory)

    Board:
    RZ/G2UL Evaluation Kit (SMARC)

    Hardware Connection:

    (1) Set for DIP switches and jumpers as follow.

    (2) Connect the J-Link Base and the connector on the SMARC Module Board with JTAG cable.
        When connecting the conversion adapter "J-Link 9-pin Cortex-M Adapter" made by SEGGER will be required.
    (3) Connect PMOD0 PIN7-12 on SMARC Carrier Board and Pmod LED.
        Connect PMOD1 PIN7-12 on SMARC Carrier Board and Pmod BUTTON.


Note:
1. Segger RTT block address is required to connect J-Link RTTViewer. 
   The RTT block address can be confirmed by searching "_SEGGER_RTT" in .map file 
   which is located in Debug folder and generated when building.
